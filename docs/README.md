Take a look at the folder
[`frameworks/oxbytei/samples`](frameworks/oxbytei/samples)
for sample resources, especially at the XML catalog.


Note: The plugins used by oXbytei do not use oXygen's functions for
accessing the documents currently edited. The plugins operate on the
files as they were last saved to disk.
