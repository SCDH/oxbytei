# SCDH &lt;oXygen/> Extension #

![release](https://github.com/scdh/scdh-oxygen-extension/actions/workflows/release.yml/badge.svg)
![tests](https://github.com/scdh/scdh-oxygen-extension/actions/workflows/test-main.yml/badge.svg)

An &lt;oXygen/> extension with some high-level functions that
facilitate everyday work on TEI documents.

- set `@xml:lang` by selecting a language registered in the header
- set `@ref` of `<persName>` etc. by selecting a person from a locally
  stored personography that is bound to a local URI scheme defined by
  `<prefixDef>`


There should be some [customization](#customization) in the edition's
&lt;oXygen/> project.



## Package ##

### Installation ###

The framework can be installed with &lt;oXygen/>'s installation and
update mechanism. Therefore, the following URL has to be entered into
the form "Show addons from:" of the dialogue box from "Help" -> "Install
new addons...".

[https://scdh.github.io/scdh-oxygen-framework/descriptor.xml](https://scdh.github.io/scdh-oxygen-framework/descriptor.xml)

As an alternative, the framework can be packaged locally for
installation or it can be installed for hacking.

### Packaging locally ###

Packaging is done with [`maven`](https://maven.apache.org/).

```{shell}
mvn package
```
	
This will create a file named
`scdh-oxygen-extension-<VERSION>-package.zip` in the `target`
folder. This zip-File is the same as the one distributed under the
above mentioned URL.

### Hacking / Development ###

Installing the framework as an &lt;oXygen/> package will make it
read-only. For hacking on it's code you can install it by registering
the path to the cloned repository in &lt;oXygen/>'s settings.

- 1) Clone this repository into a subfolder of an &lt;oXygen/>
  project, e.g. `teip5scdh`. (It may also be sym-linked there.)

- 2) Start &lt;oXygen/> and select `Options` -> `Preferences` from the
  menu. Expand `Document Type Association` on the left and select
  `Locations [P]` under it. Click `Add` to add a new additional
  framework directory.  Enter `${pdu}/teip5scdh` as directory and click
  `OK`. (Note: `${pdu}` is an [editor
  variable](https://www.oxygenxml.com/doc/versions/22.1/ug-editor/topics/editor-variables.html)
  and points to the root folder of the current project.
  
- 3) Close and restart &lt;oXygen/>. The framework is now present as an
  extension to the default TEI P5 framework.

## Regression Tests ##

There are regression tests for the XSL transformations based on
[`XSpec`](https://github.com/xspec/xspec) in `test/xspec`. The tests
can easily be run with maven from the root directory of the
repository:

```{shell}
mvn test
```

Maven will install all required packages for running the tests,
e.g. `XSpec` and `Saxon-HE`. A detailed test report can be viewed with
the browser in `target/xspec-reports/index.html`.

Note, that the tests need intermediate files to be generated in mavens
`generate-resources` phase. If you want to run the tests manually,
have a look at the pom-file to see what's needed.


### Releasing ###

Releases of installable packages will be created with github actions
on tags with a name matching the pattern
`v\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+(-.*)?`,
i.e. `v<MAJOR>.<MINOR>.<BUGFIX>[-<SUFFIX>]`. To produce a release:

- first push the branch to be released
- then tag it with the tag name matching the above pattern

This will produce a release on [releases/tag/<TAG_NAME>](releases/tag)
and update the [descriptor
file](https://scdh.github.io/scdh-oxygen-framework/descriptor.xml).

NOTE: The tag name **must equal** the version name in the
[pom.xml](pom.xml)!



## Customization ##

The framework can and should be adapted to your project's needs by
customization. Customization includes:

- redirect to a bibliography through an [XML
  catalog](https://www.oxygenxml.com/doc/versions/23.1/ug-editor/topics/using-XML-Catalogs.html#using-XML-Catalogs)
- redirect to a catalog of witnesses through an XML catalog 
- redirect to local CSS with font definitions etc. through an XML
  catalog
- register the [XML
  catalog](https://www.oxygenxml.com/doc/versions/23.1/ug-editor/topics/preferences-xml-catalog.html#preferences-xml-catalog),
  e.g. put the catalog file into `resources/catalog.xml` and add
  `${pdu}/resources/catalog.xml` to the list of catalogs for your
  project (check "Project Options")
- insert a taxonomy of named objects (plants, animals, etc.) into the
  `<encodingDesc>` of each TEI documents header (by means of XInclude)
- also insert a taxonomy of segment types in there


Take a look at the folder
[`frameworks/teip5scdh/samples`](frameworks/teip5scdh/samples) for
sample resources, especially at the XML catalog. Without
customization, the files from this folder are used.

# Features and Usage #

## Project specific files ##

The framework does not make assumptions about your project's file
names and paths. But for some functions, it needs access to central
project files. An
[XML-catalog](https://www.oxygenxml.com/doc/versions/23.1/ug-editor/topics/using-XML-Catalogs.html?hl=xml%2Ccatalog)
can be used for redirecting from some dummy sample files, that ship
with the framework, to your project files.

You should add an XML-catalog to your project. If the catalog would
e.g. live in `resources/catalog.xml` of your project, then you should
[register](https://www.oxygenxml.com/doc/versions/23.1/ug-editor/topics/preferences-xml-catalog.html#preferences-xml-catalog)
the catalog in `${pdu}/resources/catalog.xml` in &lt;oXygen>. Please,
have a look at
[`samples/catalog.xml`](framework/teip5scdh/samples/catalog.xml) for a
sample catalog file.

Please note: All the framework files are included in subdirectories of
the framework `teip5scdh`. But when the framework is installed, the
directory name changes to a combination of its name and version. So we
cannot simply use paths like `teip5scdh/css/font.css` in the URI or
system suffix, but have to use the less distinct path suffix
`css/font.css`.

### Project specific CSS ###

You can redirect to an CSS file by redirecting the frameworkfile
`css/font.css` as you need. Here's a catalog entry to redirect to
`resources/css/font.css` in your project:

```{xml}
<!-- override CSS (font) definitions of framework -->
<uriSuffix uriSuffix="css/font.css" uri="css/font.css"/>
<systemSuffix systemIdSuffix="css/font.css" uri="css/font.css"/>
```

### Personography ###

If there is a `<prefixDef>` in the header, which defines a URI scheme
on the protocol `psn`, `pers`, `prs`, `prsn` or `person`, an author
mode action ![icon](frameworks/teip5scdh/images/person-24.png) for
selecting a person from a personography is activated. For example, put
this in the header:

```{xml}
...
<encodingDesc>
	...
	<listPrefixDef>
		<prefixDef
			matchPattern="([a-zA-Z0-9_-]+)"
			replacementPattern="persons.xml#$1"
			ident="psn"/>
	</listPrefixDef>
	...
</encodingDesc>
```

If the linked file `persons.xml` is present, then all the persones
listed there are presented in a selection dialog and a fragment like
this is created:

```{xml}
<persName ref="psn:BadraddinbalAttar">BadraddÄ«n</persName>
```

I strongly encourage providing a personography in a local file as a
broker to global norm data on the WWW, instead of linking to triple
stores on the WWW directly from the TEI documents. See [this
discussion](https://listserv.brown.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind1711&L=TEI-L&D=0&P=43750)
on the TEI mailing list on the subject. I also encourage defining URI
schemes via
[`<prefixDef>`](https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/de/html/ref-listPrefixDef.html),
instead of linking to external elements by IDs directly. The prefix
definition serves as an abstraction layer, makes everything explicit,
and thus enables us to write generic tools and actions like
[![icon](frameworks/teip5scdh/images/person-24.png)](frameworks/teip5scdh/externalAuthorActions/link-person.xml).


### Bibliography ###

You can redirect to a TEI document containing the project's
bibliography. It will be used for producing and resolving
bibliographic references with some functions of this framework. The
framework ships with a dummy bibliography in
`samples/biblio.xml`. Here's a catalog entry to redirect to
`Literaturverzeichnis.xml` in your project's root directory:

```{xml}
<systemSuffix systemIdSuffix="samples/biblio.xml" uri="../Literaturverzeichnis.xml"/>
<uriSuffix uriSuffix="samples/biblio.xml" uri="../Literaturverzeichnis.xml"/>
```

## Language and script direction ##

According to the [TEI
guidelines](https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/de/html/WD.html#WDWM),
the writing direction of a script should be encoded by the `@xml:lang`
attribute. Moreover, the languages, that used in a TEI encoded
document, should be listed in `teiHeader/profileDesc/langUsage`.

Here is an example header:

```{xml}
  <profileDesc xml:id="profileDesc">
	 <langUsage xml:id="langUsage">
		<language ident="ar">Arabisch</language>
		<language ident="ar-DE">Arabisch in Umschrift nach Brockelmann/Wehr</language>
		<language ident="de">Deutsch</language>
		<language ident="en">English</language>
	 </langUsage>
  </profileDesc>
```

The framework offers a functions for setting the `@xml:lang` attribute
by selecting a language from the list of languages in the header.

- `Change language` author mode action 
  - is available in the Toolbar:
	![languageicon](frameworks/teip5scdh/images/lang-24.png) (Note:
	The icon was desigend by Onur Mustak Cobanli an is distributed on
	[http://languageicon.org/](http://languageicon.org/) by under a CC
	licence with Relax-Attribution term.)
  - is available through content completion (Return)
  - is available in the `TEI P5` menu
- content completion is active in text mode

In order to get nice rendering in author mode, you should provide CSS
for the used languages through the project specific CSS file. Here is
an example:

```{css}
@namespace xml "http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace";

[xml|lang="ar"] {
    direction: rtl !important;
}

[xml|lang="de"] {
    direction: ltr !important;
}

[xml|lang="en"] {
    direction: ltr !important;
}

[xml|lang="ar-DE"] {
    direction: ltr !important;
}
```
